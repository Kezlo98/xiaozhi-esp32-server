# An Open Letter to Developers

"The ducks in the spring river are the first to know when the water warms, just as the pufferfish begins its upstream journey!"

Dear friend, I'm John, a Java developer at an ordinary company. Today, with utmost sincerity, I'm writing this open letter to you who loves AI technology and innovation.

Half a year ago, I came across many excellent projects like `Dify`, `Chat2DB`, and other AI-related projects. I thought to myself, how great it would be if I could participate in these projects. Unfortunately, "I had no way to serve my country, having written code in vain for ten years."

I first saw the Shrimp Brother team's video in early 2025. I was very curious about how they achieved it, and I wanted to replicate their backend service to build a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Unfortunately, what I've created is still just an artificial "idiot" - it has low concurrency, no soul, slow response, and many bugs.

The Shrimp Brother team is our learning role model, and I really want to have an intelligent Xiaozhi backend service like theirs. But I can understand their decision not to open source. "A single flower blooming doesn't make spring; only when a hundred flowers bloom together does spring fill the garden." The era of AI flourishing everywhere may be realized in our generation. We can use our own hands to build a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Personally, I believe that what they can achieve, we can too - it's just a matter of time. I call this "Our Journey to the West."

So what difficulties will we encounter on this journey? I think there will be no fewer than eighty-one tribulations. Along the way, various demons will certainly appear, but there will also be immortals secretly helping us, and others will join our pilgrimage team.

If you found the above amusing, I feel very fortunate. If I can make you smile for five seconds among the 30,000+ days of your life, I've made a small contribution to you.

Will this idea of a low-cost civilian Jarvis fail? I don't know, but isn't such failure quite common in the lives of ordinary people?

In the future, one thing is certain: someone will definitely fully replicate the Shrimp Brother team's functionality and achieve a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Will this project be us?

I look forward to moving forward with you and creating the future together.
